<h3>
HI!!! This is my first journal entry! Today we learned about...

how to add things to my online version of my website
</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Open my terminal and navigate to my folder by typing cd ./desktop/c27dk.github.io</li>

	<li>If I want to see if I added anything I can type git status and it can show me my changes</li>

	<li>to add what I made I type git add .</li>

	<li>Then I commit my changes and this means adding a little note that marks what I did so I saw git commit -m "whatever I did"</li>

	<li>To finish it off and put my changes online I type git push</li>
</ol>
<h3>
	2nd Entry: Today I started to change the positioning of the butterflies on the home page. I want to create an about me page and then add another butterfly for it. I also need to learn how to position my text.
</h3>

<h3>
	3rd Entry: Today I changed the position of the butterflies on my home page and added my about me page. I want to add the text that says "journal" "about me" and "projects".
</h3>
