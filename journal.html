	Welcome to my journal!
</h1>
</center>
<h2>
HI!!! This is my first journal entry! Today we learned about...

how to add things to my online version of my website
</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Open my terminal and navigate to my folder by typing cd ./desktop/c27dk.github.io</li>

	<li>If I want to see if I added anything I can type git status and it can show me my changes</li>

	<li>to add what I made I type git add .</li>

	<li>Then I commit my changes and this means adding a little note that marks what I did so I saw git commit -m "whatever I did"</li>

	<li>To finish it off and put my changes online I type git push</li>
</ol>
<h2>
	2nd Entry: Today I started to change the positioning of the butterflies on the home page. I want to create an about me page and then add another butterfly for it. I also need to learn how to position my text.
</h2>

<h2>
	3rd Entry: Today I changed the position of the butterflies on my home page and added my about me page. I want to add the text that says "journal" "about me" and "projects".
</h2>

<h2>
	4th entry: Today I centered my text, made my boxes project, and added different projects to my projects page. I want to create a calm but cute vibe for my website. Maybe I will add more to my home page later.
</h2>
<h2>
	5th entry: Today I changed my boxes project so now if you hover over one of the boxes, there is a butterfly.
</h2>
<h2>
	6th entry: I did my jumpscares! Once I understood that in javascript the periods mean that you're going into whatever word you said before, like style, it was much easier to just try things out.
</h2>
<h2>
	Questions:
	1. why do you sometimes need commas in between things (ex. the colors)?
	2. are there interactions other than click and mouse move?
	3. what does having (event) do? is it a placeholder?

</h2>
<h2>
	Today I made my bubble project. I think I'm starting to actually understand how javascript works but I still don't really get how to add sound.
</h2>

<h2>
	I added the bubble pop sound to bubble project! I just had to figure out how to put the converted mp3 into my project folder so that I could reference it in my code.
</h2>
<h2>
	Today i finished my gratitude card! I think this project really helped me understand how to combine html and javascript. I made my divs and styled them in html but then used javascript to change their opacities based on the "clicks." I also now understand that to make the code a loop, I just had to reset everything back to zero at the end.
</h2>

<h2>
	I asked ChatGPT to explain how classes work and it compared it to a car manufacturing factory where different cars are built. It said classes are like predifined design templates for various car models. Each template defines specific styles and features for a particular type of car.  
</h2>


<h2>
	Today we worked with random strings. first we learned how to create a string. you have to put commas between each part of the string. we then learned how to make a variable that selects a random number so that you can use that variable to select a random part of the string. we then created an event listener so that when you click, it console logs a random piece of the string. you have to put the variable in the event listener so that it doesn't just do it once. you then can use this knowledge to instead of console logging one part of the string, it appears on the website when you click. 
</h2>
<h2>
	Today I finished my Valentine's Day card. I set the x and y variables to the same values as the position of the heart in its style so that when I move the heart, it doesn't go back to zero before moving. 
</h2>
<h2>
	Today I added my slideshow to my website and replaced my about me page with it. When anchoring it to my website, I had to put ./reveal.js-master/reveal.html in my a tag/href because you have to go into the reveal js folder before accessing the page.
