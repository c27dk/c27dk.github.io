<h1>
	Welcome to my jounrnal!
</h1>
</center>
<h2>
HI!!! This is my first journal entry! Today we learned about...

how to add things to my online version of my website
</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Open my terminal and navigate to my folder by typing cd ./desktop/c27dk.github.io</li>

	<li>If I want to see if I added anything I can type git status and it can show me my changes</li>

	<li>to add what I made I type git add .</li>

	<li>Then I commit my changes and this means adding a little note that marks what I did so I saw git commit -m "whatever I did"</li>

	<li>To finish it off and put my changes online I type git push</li>
</ol>
<h2>
	2nd Entry: Today I started to change the positioning of the butterflies on the home page. I want to create an about me page and then add another butterfly for it. I also need to learn how to position my text.
</h2>

<h2>
	3rd Entry: Today I changed the position of the butterflies on my home page and added my about me page. I want to add the text that says "journal" "about me" and "projects".
</h2>

<h2>
	4th entry: Today I centered my text, made my boxes project, and added different projects to my projects page. I want to create a calm but cute vibe for my website. Maybe I will add more to my home page later.
</h2>
<h2>
	5th entry: Today I changed my boxes project so now if you hover over one of the boxes, there is a butterfly.
</h2>
<h2>
	6th entry: I did my jumpscares! Once I understood that in javascript the periods mean that you're going into whatever word you said before, like style, it was much easier to just try things out.
</h2>
<h2>
	Questions:
	1. why do you sometimes need commas in between things (ex. the colors)?
	2. are there interactions other than click and mouse move?
	3. what does having (event) do? is it a placeholder?

</h2>
<h2>
	Today I made my bubble project. I think I'm starting to actually understand how javascript works but I still don't really get how to add sound.
</h2>

<h2>
	I added the bubble pop sound to bubble project! I just had to figure out how to put the converted mp3 into my project folder so that I could reference it in my code.
